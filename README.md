Example Playbook
----------------

Here's an example playbook that configures a vhost `/prod/data-store` with three users, an exchange, and two queues. The exchange has two queues bound to it.

```yaml
- hosts: amqp_brokers
  roles:
    - role: cyverse-ansible.rabbitmq_vhost
      rabbitmq_admin_user: admin
      rabbitmq_vhost_name: /prod/data-store
      rabbitmq_vhost_users:
        - name: admin
          configure_priv: .*
          write_priv: .*
          read_priv: .*
        - name: irods
          write_priv: .*
        - name: de
          read_priv: .*
      rabbitmq_vhost_exchanges:
        - name: irods
          type: topic

        - name: type-detection
          bindings:
